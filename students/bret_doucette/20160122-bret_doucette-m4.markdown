# Bret Doucette - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I wanted to become comfortable with JavaScript and more comfortable with algorithmic thinking. Game Time helped with both of these. I also wanted to focus on my weaker areas. I also redid two projects from module one (Linked Lists and Mastermind) and wrote blog posts on topics that confused me (sessions v. cookies, n+1 queries, and time in Rails).

### Attendance

This module I attended all days but one.
